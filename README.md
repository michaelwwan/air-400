# Video-Based Infant Respiration Estimation & AIR-400 Dataset

This is the official repository of our paper:

Here we provide our model code, training checkpoints, and annotated dataset to support automatic estimation of infant respiration waveforms and respiration rate from natural video footage, with the help of spatiotemporal computer vision models and infant-specific region-of-interest tracking.

## Requirements & Setup

## Quickstart: Inference

(Simple instructions for someone to run a pretrained model on their own video data.)

(Link to pretrained models on Google Drive.)

## Annotated Infant Respiration Dataset (AIR-400)

(Link to dataset, with basic description of how it is organized.) 

## Reproducing Paper Results

#### Preprocessing

(Example of how to preprocess AIR-400 video data.)

#### Training

(Example of how to retrain one of the main models in the paper, on AIR-400 data.)

#### Testing
